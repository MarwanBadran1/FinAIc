📰 Trump's 'pay-to-play' deals blur line between govt. & free market
📝 It seems "pay to play" may be the name of the game for corporate leaders under the second Trump administration. Nvidia (NVDA) and, reportedly, AMD (AMD), will give the US government 15% of their China chip sales. The artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker deal comes after the Trump administration secured an additional $100 billion investment from Apple (AAPL), which seemed to mitigate the president's tariff threats. Harvard University executive fellow and former Medtronic CEO Bill George and Pangaea Policy founder Terry Haines examine what the deal signals about the state of corporate America under Trump and how the president is blurring the lines between government and free-market capitalism.

📰 Selling AI Chips to China? Nvidia & AMD Agree Unusual 15% Fee | Explained
📝 Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government in a deal to secure export licenses, an unusual arrangement that may unnerve both US companies and Beijing. The arrangement reflects US President Donald Trump's consistent effort to engineer a financial payout for America in return for concessions on trade. His administration has shown a willingness to relax trade conditions like tariffs in return for giant investment in the US, as with Apple's pledge to spend $600 billion on domestic manufacturing. But such a narrow, select export tax has little precedent in modern corporate history. Our trade tsar Brendan Murray joins Stephen Carroll and Tom Mackenzie on Bloomberg Radio for more.
